# Introduction

Motivation, research question, context

Use case: A regional hospital wants to improve its preventive care and identify patients with an increased risk of heart disease at an early stage.
Until now, risk assessment has mainly been carried out by doctors on the basis of individual factors (age, BMI, blood pressure). However, the hospital wants to understand:
Which factors have the greatest influence on the risk of heart disease
How these factors reinforce or weaken each other
Whether modern machine learning models provide better predictions than traditional statistics
At what thresholds the risk increases significantly
How patients can be given targeted preventive care
To this end, the hospital has commissioned our project team to analyze the Person Health Indicator dataset.

The overarching question of the project
“How well can the risk of heart disease be predicted using personal health indicators, and which factors have the strongest influence?”
We answer this question in two dimensions:
I. Risk prediction (predictive task)
Can a model reliably identify patients at increased risk?
→ For this: GLM Binomial, SVM, Neural Network
II. Risk explanation (interpretation task)
Which factors drive the risk, and how do these effects unfold?
→ For this: Linear Model, Poisson GLM, GAM 

What the hospital ultimately receives
A clear, clinically useful answer:
Early warning model: Who is at risk?
Top 5 main risk factors: What drives the risk?
Threshold values: When does a factor become critical?
Recommendations: Where is patient intervention worthwhile (exercise, BMI, sleep)?
Model comparison: Which model is the most reliable?
